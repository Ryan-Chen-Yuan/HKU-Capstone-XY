This project presents Zhiji AI Assistant, a WeChat Mini Program designed to provide non-clinical emotional support through natural language interaction. The system leverages large language models (LLMs) to serve adolescent users in managing and reflecting on their emotions. The project addresses the significant supply-demand gap in China's psychological service industry, where professional resources are concentrated in tier-one cities with prohibitively high costs (¥500–¥1000 per session). Traditional cultural values often stigmatize mental health discussions, deterring users from seeking offline assistance.

The system features three core modules: an empathetic AI chatbot for emotional support, a community platform for user interaction and knowledge sharing, and a psychological assessment tool for mood tracking and trend analysis. The technical implementation utilizes Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model for natural language processing, Flask backend for API services, and WeChat Mini Program for the frontend interface. The project demonstrates the potential of AI technology to provide accessible, low-cost mental health support while maintaining user privacy and data security.
