## **1. Background and Current Overview**

As the pace of modern life accelerates and information overload intensifies, mental health issues are becoming increasingly prevalent, with a growing demand for psychological support. Traditional mental health counseling often faces challenges such as high costs, limited resources, and high barriers to access. Many people experiencing subclinical mental health problems struggle to receive timely and professional help. In this context, AI-powered conversational mental health assistants have emerged as a potential solution.

The exploration of AI in mental health counseling dates back decades. As early as the 1960s, the simple chatbot ELIZA was designed to simulate patient conversations, though its functionality was limited. With the advent of deep learning, advanced dialogue systems powered by large language models have significantly enhanced emotional recognition and natural language generation capabilities. Modern AI assistants can analyze multimodal user input — such as text, voice, and facial expressions — to assess emotional states in real time, offering continuous and dynamic companionship beyond what human therapists can provide. Especially since 2022, models like ChatGPT have sparked a wave of innovation, and Chinese tech companies have actively developed their own large language models and applications. AI is reshaping the landscape of mental health services — intelligent chatbots now offer 24/7 emotional support, while big data analytics help detect potential psychological risks.

Currently, AI-based mental health chatbots are developing rapidly both domestically and internationally, with diverse approaches emerging. On one hand, several overseas applications — such as Woebot, Wysa, and Youper — integrate psychological techniques like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) into conversational AI to help users manage emotions through daily interactions. Research shows that these AI-based interventions can be effective and well-received in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. On the other hand, driven by favorable policies and investment, the domestic market in China has seen a surge of innovation from both startups and tech giants. The shared goal is to use AI technology to reduce the cost of mental health services and expand access through scalable and inclusive solutions.

## **2. Comparative Analysis of Three Products**

This report analyzes and compares three representative AI mental health assistants: Tencent’s **Yuanbao** (China), **Youper** (international), and **Qingzhi Planet** (China). These products differ in terms of functionality, target users, user experience, and technical implementation, reflecting varying design philosophies in the field.

### **2.1 Tencent Yuanbao**

Yuanbao is a general-purpose AI assistant launched by Tencent, powered by the Hunyuan LLM and DeepSeek models. While not specifically designed for mental health counseling, it offers general support for tasks such as writing assistance, creative generation, and Q&A through mobile apps or WeChat mini-programs. Despite its general-purpose nature, Yuanbao is capable of providing empathetic and insightful responses to psychological queries thanks to its strong natural language understanding capabilities. Analyses have shown that it can offer thoughtful suggestions for complex emotional issues, sometimes resembling the insights of a human therapist. However, Yuanbao lacks specialized modules for emotion analysis and does not currently support multimodal emotion recognition.

### **2.2 Youper**

Youper is an AI-driven mental health app developed by a U.S.-based startup in 2016. It is positioned as a personal emotional wellness assistant designed to help users manage anxiety, depression, and stress. The app combines CBT techniques with an AI chatbot that guides users through emotional check-ins and therapeutic exercises via daily conversations. Key features include: daily mood check-ins, emotion journaling, scientifically validated mental health exercises such as cognitive restructuring and mindfulness breathing, and built-in psychological assessments covering areas like anxiety, confidence, and sleep quality. Based on user input, Youper provides tailored recommendations and personalized emotional training plans. It effectively integrates a self-help mental health manual into a chatbot format, offering both empathy and actionable guidance.

Youper is available as a mobile app on iOS and Android. Upon first use, users can select their mental health goals (e.g., reduce anxiety or improve sleep), after which the app initiates a personalized plan. During chats, the AI prompts questions like “How are you feeling today?”, responds empathetically, and suggests next steps such as a three-minute breathing exercise or cognitive restructuring.

### **2.3 Qingzhi Planet**

Qingzhi Planet is a Chinese-developed AI mental health application available via WeChat mini-program and Android app. It offers a comprehensive set of mental health services, including psychological assessments, emotional analysis, AI counseling dialogues, emotional regulation training, relationship advice, and initial crisis intervention. Users can take mental health tests to understand their condition and receive AI-generated guidance for issues like breakups or workplace stress. The platform incorporates CBT exercises, mindfulness meditation, and other psychological practices, aiming to foster long-term emotional regulation habits. In terms of user experience, the product emphasizes real-time response and structured guidance, combining chat interactions with button-based navigation for a smoother experience. It also prioritizes privacy with end-to-end encryption and minimal storage of conversation history — although this may limit users’ ability to review past sessions. Overall, Qingzhi Planet offers a well-rounded solution, suitable for individuals dealing with mild to moderate psychological stress.

## **4. Product Limitations & Improvement Directions**

- **Yuanbao (Tencent)**: As a general AI assistant, Yuanbao lacks **domain-specific depth** for mental health use cases. It doesn’t offer structured assessments, emotion tracking, or guided interventions — interactions are largely reactive and generic. Its responses may be superficial and lack therapeutic depth. Additionally, there’s risk of inappropriate content generation when dealing with sensitive mental health issues. **Improvement direction**: Tencent could consider fine-tuning Yuanbao for counseling contexts, incorporating trained therapeutic conversation models. Adding **emotional support tools** like mood journaling and daily mental exercises would also enhance long-term user engagement.
- **Youper**: Its main drawbacks include **limited content depth** and **accessibility barriers**. While CBT-based, its interaction patterns can feel repetitive over time, especially for long-term or complex issues. Furthermore, it currently **lacks Chinese localization**, limiting its usability for non-English speakers. The **paid subscription model** may deter users with limited financial means, undermining its inclusivity. **Improvement direction**: Youper could expand its conversation library to include more therapeutic models (e.g., humanistic therapy, self-compassion training) and adopt more advanced generative models for greater dialogue variation. A more inclusive pricing strategy — such as freemium tiers or nonprofit sponsorship — would improve accessibility. Finally, adding **crisis response mechanisms**, such as suicide risk detection and hotline referrals, is essential for safety and ethical responsibility.
- **Qingzhi Planet**: Although feature-rich, **over-complexity** may hinder usability. Too many modules and technical jargon may overwhelm general users. **Improvement direction**: Simplify the interface and onboarding process with intuitive guides and clear design. Consider introducing **human-in-the-loop support**, such as periodic reviews by certified counselors or live Q&A sessions, to build trust and provide a sense of security during critical moments. This balance between AI automation and human oversight would enhance user experience and credibility.

## **5. Key Takeaways for Future Product Development**

**Key features worth adopting:**

- *Always-available support*: Like Yuanbao and Qingzhi Planet, a **low-barrier, 24/7 chatbot** accessible via WeChat or app ensures users can seek emotional support immediately without delay or hesitation.
