# Progress 1 update : Su YingCheng

This document summarizes my *Progress Update 1* for the capstone project "AI-Powered Counseling Ecosystem for Adolescent Mental Health Support".

## Achievements

### Complete UI and interaction design for event-analysis function

For the event-analysis function, the UI and interaction design have been completed as per the requirements. The following features were implemented:

1. **Event Card Design**:

   - Key events are displayed as individual cards, ensuring a clear and structured layout.
   - Each card includes the event details, along with interaction buttons.

2. **User Interaction Options**:

   - Users can provide feedback on extracted events using the following actions:

     - **"✓"**: To confirm the accuracy of the event.

     - **"Edit"**: To allow users to modify the event details if necessary.

3. **Mock Data Integration**:

   - The UI is integrated with mock data to simulate key event extraction, ensuring a functional demonstration of the feature.

   

## Ongoing Tasks

### **Integrate with Mini Program Main Framework**:

- The event-analysis UI and interaction design are being integrated into the main framework of the mini program. This ensures seamless navigation and consistency with the overall application structure.

## Future Task

### **Prepare Interfaces for Backend Event Extraction API**:

- Interfaces are being designed and implemented to support the future functionality of extracting key events directly from dialogue texts.
- These interfaces will allow easy integration with the backend or additional modules once the event extraction logic is developed.

## Conclusion

The current project focuses on the miniprogram , while event analysis  development will be my next priority. Overall, I have a steady progress on the project as planned by the team.
